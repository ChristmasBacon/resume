  My Degree
</h3>
<p>
  At Universidad del Turabo I pursued a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering.
  I specialized myself in software design with some electronic design, mainly digital.
  I took courses in innovation and software engineering apart from the required courses.
  In my time here, I participated in various extracurricular activities such as
  being part of some student Engineering organizations. Some of these include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    IEE: Treasurer
  </li>
  <li>
    ACM: Vice-President
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  While at Universidad Del Turabo I also received a scholarship for the Honor association.
  This association apart from providing me with the resources to pay for classes and books
  also provided me with many workshops, opportunities to visit museums, and be able to participate
  in activities to help the community.

<p>
While studying here and shortly after graduating I was able to participate in various
<a href="/Experience">Internships</a> which helped me gain the experience I have today.
